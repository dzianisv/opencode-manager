# OpenCode Manager

Mobile-first web interface for OpenCode AI agents. Manage, control, and code with OpenCode from any device - your phone, tablet, or desktop. Features Git integration, file management, and real-time chat in a responsive PWA. Deploy with Docker for instant setup. View diffs, edit files and much more.

## Why We Use a Fork of OpenCode

This project builds OpenCode from [VibeTechnologies/opencode](https://github.com/VibeTechnologies/opencode), a fork of the official [sst/opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) repository. We maintain this fork to include critical fixes that haven't yet been merged upstream.

### Current Fork Enhancements

**File Persistence for Large Tool Outputs** ([PR #6234](https://github.com/sst/opencode/pull/6234))

The official OpenCode has a known issue where large tool outputs (WebFetch, Bash, MCP tools) can overflow the context window, causing:
- "prompt is too long" errors (e.g., `202744 tokens > 200000 maximum`)
- Sessions becoming stuck/unresponsive
- Loss of work when context overflows mid-conversation

Our fork includes the fix from PR #6234 which implements intelligent file persistence:
- Tool outputs exceeding 30,000 characters are saved to disk instead of the context
- The AI model receives a file path with instructions to explore the data using Read/Grep/jq
- Context stays small, preventing overflow errors
- Files are automatically cleaned up when sessions are deleted

This fix is essential for production use cases where AI agents frequently fetch documentation, analyze large codebases, or work with verbose tool outputs.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **VibeTechnologies/opencode fork** (branch: `dev`) contains two fixes:
   - Large tool outputs (>30k chars) are saved to disk instead of context (`packages/opencode/src/session/prompt.ts`)
   - Auto-allow read access to OpenCode storage directory to avoid permission prompts for reading saved tool results (`packages/opencode/src/tool/read.ts`)

2. **opencode-manager** deploys the fork at container startup via:
   - `docker-compose.yml` - `OPENCODE_FORK_REPO` and `OPENCODE_FORK_BRANCH` env vars
   - `scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh` - `install_from_fork()` function

**Test Results** (all 3 integration tests pass):
- 883,082 character output saved to file successfully
- No retry loop / sessions didn't get stuck
- Sessions can continue conversation after context-heavy operations

### Staying Up-to-Date

We regularly sync our fork with upstream sst/opencode to incorporate new features and fixes. Once PR #6234 is merged upstream, we plan to switch back to the official release.

## Coming Soon

-  **Authentication** - User authentication and session management

## Installation

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Simple one-liner
docker run -d -p 5003:5003 -v opencode-workspace:/workspace ghcr.io/dzianisv/opencode-manager

# Or with API keys
docker run -d -p 5003:5003 \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... \
  -v opencode-workspace:/workspace \
  ghcr.io/dzianisv/opencode-manager
```

Access the application at http://localhost:5003

**With Docker Compose** (for persistent volumes and env vars):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VibeTechnologies/opencode-manager.git
cd opencode-manager

# Configure API keys (optional)
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-..." > .env

# Start
docker compose up -d
```

The Docker setup automatically:
- Installs OpenCode CLI on first run
- Starts Whisper (STT) and Chatterbox (TTS) servers
- Sets up persistent volumes for workspace and database

**Docker Commands:**
```bash
docker compose up -d        # Start
docker compose down         # Stop
docker compose logs -f      # View logs
docker compose restart      # Restart
docker exec -it opencode-manager sh  # Shell access
```

### Dev Server Ports

The Docker container exposes ports `5100-5103` for running dev servers inside your repositories. Configure your project's dev server to use one of these ports and access it directly from your browser.

**Example usage:**
```bash
# Vite (vite.config.ts)
server: { port: 5100, host: '0.0.0.0' }

# Next.js
next dev -p 5100 -H 0.0.0.0

# Express/Node
app.listen(5100, '0.0.0.0')
```

Access your dev server at `http://localhost:5100` (or your Docker host IP).

To customize the exposed ports, edit `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "5003:5003"      # OpenCode Manager
  - "5100:5100"      # Dev server 1
  - "5101:5101"      # Dev server 2
  - "5102:5102"      # Dev server 3
  - "5103:5103"      # Dev server 4
```

### Global Agent Instructions (AGENTS.md)

OpenCode Manager creates a default `AGENTS.md` file in the workspace config directory (`/workspace/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`). This file provides global instructions to AI agents working within the container.

**Default instructions include:**
- Reserved ports (5003 for OpenCode Manager, 5551 for OpenCode server)
- Available dev server ports (5100-5103)
- Guidelines for binding to `0.0.0.0` for Docker accessibility

**Editing AGENTS.md:**
- Via UI: Settings > OpenCode > Global Agent Instructions
- Via file: Edit `/workspace/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` directly

This file is merged with any repository-specific `AGENTS.md` files, with repository instructions taking precedence for their respective codebases.

### Option 2: Azure VM Deployment (Quick Start)

Deploy OpenCode Manager to an Azure VM with a single command. Includes automatic HTTPS via Cloudflare tunnel and Basic Auth protection.

**Prerequisites:**
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed and logged in (`az login`)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed
- SSH keys configured (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`)

**Quick Deploy:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VibeTechnologies/opencode-manager.git
cd opencode-manager

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Deploy to Azure (creates VM, configures Docker, sets up tunnel)
bun run scripts/deploy.ts
```

The script will:
1. Create an Azure resource group and VM (Standard_D2s_v5 by default)
2. Install Docker and deploy OpenCode Manager
3. Set up Caddy reverse proxy with Basic Auth
4. Create a Cloudflare tunnel for HTTPS access
5. Enable YOLO mode (auto-approve all AI permissions)

**After deployment, you'll receive:**
- Tunnel URL: `https://xxx-xxx.trycloudflare.com`
- Username: `admin` (default)
- Password: Auto-generated or prompted

**Environment Variables (optional):**

Create a `.env` file before deploying to configure:

```bash
# Basic Auth
AUTH_USERNAME=admin
AUTH_PASSWORD=your-secure-password

# Azure Configuration
AZURE_LOCATION=westus2
AZURE_VM_SIZE=Standard_D2s_v5

# GitHub Token (for cloning private repos)
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx

# AI Provider Keys (optional - can also configure via OAuth in UI)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
GEMINI_API_KEY=xxx

# OpenCode Fork (for context overflow fix - default)
OPENCODE_FORK_REPO=VibeTechnologies/opencode
OPENCODE_FORK_BRANCH=dev
```

**Deployment Commands:**

```bash
# Deploy new VM
bun run scripts/deploy.ts

# Check status (shows tunnel URL, credentials, container status)
bun run scripts/deploy.ts --status

# Update to latest code (pulls from GitHub, rebuilds containers)
bun run scripts/deploy.ts --update

# Sync local OpenCode auth to VM (GitHub Copilot, Anthropic OAuth)
bun run scripts/deploy.ts --sync-auth

# Update environment variables
bun run scripts/deploy.ts --update-env

# Change Basic Auth password
bun run scripts/deploy.ts --update-auth

# Re-enable YOLO mode (auto-approve permissions)
bun run scripts/deploy.ts --yolo

# Destroy all Azure resources
bun run scripts/deploy.ts --destroy
```

**Syncing Authentication:**

If you have GitHub Copilot or Anthropic OAuth configured locally, sync it to your VM:

```bash
# First, authenticate locally with OpenCode
opencode
/connect github-copilot

# Then sync to your Azure VM
bun run scripts/deploy.ts --sync-auth
```

**SSH Access:**

```bash
# Get VM IP and SSH command
bun run scripts/deploy.ts --status

# SSH into VM
ssh azureuser@<VM_IP>

# View container logs
ssh azureuser@<VM_IP> "sudo docker logs opencode-manager -f"
```

**Cost Estimate:**
- Standard_D2s_v5 (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM): ~$70/month
- Use `--destroy` when not in use to avoid charges

### Option 3: Native Local Development (macOS)

Run OpenCode Manager natively on macOS without Docker. This is ideal for development or when you want the web UI to connect to an existing OpenCode instance running in your terminal.

**Prerequisites:**
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for frontend)
- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) installed: `curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`
- (Optional) [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/) for tunnel mode: `brew install cloudflared`

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VibeTechnologies/opencode-manager.git
cd opencode-manager

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.local.example .env

# Start with Cloudflare tunnel (spawns opencode serve + creates public URL)
pnpm start

# Or connect to an existing opencode instance with tunnel
pnpm start:client

# Or start without tunnel (local only)
pnpm start:no-tunnel
```

**Available Commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm start` | Start with Cloudflare tunnel - spawns `opencode serve` + public URL |
| `pnpm start:client` | Connect to existing opencode instance with tunnel |
| `pnpm start:no-tunnel` | Start without tunnel (local only) |
| `bun scripts/start-native.ts --help` | Show all available options |

**Client Mode:**

When using `--client` mode, the script will:
1. Scan for running opencode processes using `lsof`
2. Check health via `/doc` endpoint on each discovered port
3. Fetch version info from `/global/health`
4. List all healthy instances with directory, version, and PID
5. Let you select which instance to connect to

```bash
$ pnpm start:client

╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗

╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝

🔍 Searching for running opencode servers...

📋 Found multiple opencode servers:

  [1] Port 5551
      Directory: /Users/you/project-a
      Version: 1.1.2
      PID: 12345

  [2] Port 61782
      Directory: /Users/you/project-b
      Version: 1.0.223
      PID: 67890

Select server [1]: 
```

This is useful when you already have `opencode` running in a terminal and want the web UI to connect to it without spawning a separate server.

**Without Tunnel (Local Only):**

```bash
# Start without tunnel
pnpm start:no-tunnel

# Or connect to existing instance without tunnel
bun scripts/start-native.ts --client
```

**Custom Port:**

```bash
# Use a different backend port
bun scripts/start-native.ts --port 3000
bun scripts/start-native.ts --client --port 3000
```

### Option 4: Local Development (Hot Reload)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VibeTechnologies/opencode-manager.git
cd opencode-manager

# Install dependencies (uses Bun workspaces)
bun install

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Start development servers (backend + frontend)
npm run dev
```

## Testing

- ✅ Backend API endpoints (health, repos, settings, OpenCode proxy)
- ✅ Authentication (with/without credentials, valid/invalid)
- ✅ Cloudflare tunnel (startup, URL generation, public access)
- ✅ Docker deployment (build, run, health checks, volumes)
- ✅ E2E test suite (voice, talk mode, browser automation)
- ✅ Database integrity
- ✅ Git operations
- ✅ Performance metrics
- ✅ Security validation

### CI/CD Integration

The QA system can be integrated into GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- name: Run QA Tests
  run: |
    .opencode/commands/qa-test.sh full
```

For complete testing documentation, see [.opencode/README.md](.opencode/README.md).
